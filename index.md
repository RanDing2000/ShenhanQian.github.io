## Bio

I am a PhD student in the [Visual Computing & Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.niessnerlab.org/) at the Technical University of Munich, working with [Prof. Matthias Nie√üner](http://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html). I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University in 2022, advised by [Prof. Shenghua Gao](https://svip-lab.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Automation at Hunan University in 2019.

My research interest lies in 3D reconstruction, neural rendering, and implicit neural representations.
